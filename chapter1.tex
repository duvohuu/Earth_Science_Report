    \section{Lateritic Weathering – Theoretical Formation Mechanism. Illustration of the Chua Hoi Son Outcrop}

        \subsection{Lateritic Weathering}

        \hspace*{0.6cm}Lateritic weathering is a complex process that involves multiple stages and diverse geochemical reactions. The formation of laterite is controlled by several factors, including climate, the composition of the parent rock, and the degree of leaching. The accumulation of iron and aluminum oxides and hydroxides play a crucial role in producing the distinctive reddish coloration and characteristic structure of laterite.

        \textbf{Illustration of Outcrop Point 2: Chua Hoi Son}

        \textbf{Coordinates:} 10°52'33''N - 106°50'25''E

        \textbf{Time:} 8:15–8:45 AM, October 31, 2025

        \textbf{Weather:} Hot, partly cloudy

        \textbf{Description:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Structure of the outcrop:} Formed from chemical sedimentary processes:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Composed of parent rock (shale, partly basalt, …)
                \item Gently sloping terrain
                \item Suitable pH level
                \item Groundwater level fluctuates slightly, about 3–4 m between rainy and dry seasons
                \item Sufficiently long weathering duration, forming minerals such as Fe\textsuperscript{2+}, Fe\textsuperscript{3+}, Mn\textsuperscript{2+}, Al\textsuperscript{3+}, …
            \end{itemize}
            \item At the Chua Hoi Son site, laterite belonging to the Thu Duc Formation can be observed. It has a brown to reddish-brown color, unevenly distributed, with large, solid, irregular pores that are not saturated with water. When completely weathered, the laterite becomes very hard. The mineral composition includes clay, sand, and oxides. The unweathered part is softer, and when scraped, produces reddish-brown sand.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Formation Mechanism of Laterite}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Environmental conditions:} Suitable pH level (In tropical regions).
            \item \textbf{Initial conditions:} Parent rock must contain cations Fe\textsuperscript{2+}, Fe\textsuperscript{3+}, Mg\textsuperscript{2+}, Al\textsuperscript{3+}
            \item A groundwater table that is neither deep nor shallow.
            \item \textbf{Time condition:} Sufficiently long accumulation.
            \item When underground, Laterite rock is still soft. After being brought to the surface and exposed to the air, the rock rapidly and irreversibly hardens. The weathered part is bluish-gray and hard; the unweathered part is soft and friable, containing red, fine sand within its pores.
        \end{itemize}

        \section{Erosion – Coastal Shoreline Processes, Illustration of the Estuarine Area}

        \hspace*{0.6cm}Coastal erosion and shoreline degradation are complex processes influenced by both natural and human factors. These processes can cause significant changes in coastal topography and environment. Coastal erosion and shoreline degradation result from the combination of natural and anthropogenic factors.

        Understanding these processes is crucial for effectively implementing coastal protection and management measures, aiming to minimize damage and preserve the coastal environment.

        \textbf{Illustration of Outcrop Point 6: Estuarine Area}

        \textbf{Coordinates:} 10°23'23''N - 107°9'17''E

        \textbf{Time:} 7:00–8:00 AM, November 1, 2025

        \textbf{Weather:} Hot, partly cloudy

        \textbf{Description:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Coastal wave erosion:} Mixed with shells, black sand, and quartz. Water carries these materials along. As the water recedes, the materials move with the current and deposit elsewhere, causing erosion on one side and deposition on the other.
            \item \textbf{Water deposition:} Refers to rainwater settling in the lowest areas.
            \item \textbf{Mangrove forests at estuaries:} Trees in Vietnam's mangrove forests have stilted roots that rise above the ground, which are thick, strong, and dense. Most are plants with prop roots, such as Rhizophora, Sonneratia (Su), Bruguiera (VVet), Melaleuca (Tram), and Avicennia (MMam).
            \item \textbf{Formation of sediments by wave ripples.}
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection*{Sediment Formation Process:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Sediment deposition:} Ripples on the sea or river surface transport and accumulate particles such as sand, mud, and biological debris in layers. These layers often form wavy patterns due to the action of currents or waves.
            \item \textbf{Compaction and alteration:} Over time, the sediment layers are compacted by gravity and by the deposition of new layers on top. This process causes changes in the structure and texture of the particles, making them stick together to form sedimentary rock.
            \item \textbf{Lithification:} Dissolved minerals in groundwater penetrate the sediment layers and precipitate, binding the particles together. This process, called lithification, transforms the sediment layers into solid sedimentary rock.
        \end{itemize}

        \hspace*{0.6cm}The process of magma eruption and the formation of rhyolite in the Nha Trang Formation is a complex one, involving the generation of magma from the Earth's crust, accumulation and differentiation in the magma chamber, and finally eruption and crystallization into rhyolite rock. Studying rhyolite in this formation provides important insights into volcanic activity and the geological history of the Nha Trang area.
